# Image Encryption Project

This project provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt images using the Fernet symmetric encryption method from the `cryptography` library.

## Features

- Encrypt images to protect sensitive data.
- Decrypt images back to their original form.
- Secure key management.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image_encryption.git
   cd image_encryption
   
2.Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage

Run the script:

python image_encryption.py
Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt an image.

## Security Note
Make sure to keep the encryption_key.key file secure, as it is required to decrypt the images.
